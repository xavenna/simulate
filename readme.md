SIMULATE: A sandbox simulation.
written by xavenna
This uses the SFML Library. It is currently dynamically linked, so the libraries are required to run it.

Many things still need to be done, so this is in no way a complete project


Controls:
WASD:	move cursor around
Enter:	place selected material
QE:	cycle major material
[]:	cycle minor material
.:	clear screen
L:	set framerate to 30
;:	set framerate to 10
,:	set framerate to 4
':	display heat value (used for debugging)
